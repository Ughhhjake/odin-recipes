  <p>Furikake is a dry Japanese condiment meant to be sprinkled on top of rice. It typically consists of a mixture of
    dried and ground fish, sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt, and monosodium glutamate. Other flavorful ingredients
    such as katsuobushi (sometimes indicated on the package as bonito), or okaka (bonito flakes moistened with soy sauce
    and dried again), freeze-dried salmon particles, shiso, egg, powdered miso, vegetables, including kimchi, etc.,
    are often added to the mix.</p>
