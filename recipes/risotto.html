  <p>Risotto /rɪˈzɒtoʊ/ (Italian: [riˈzɔtto] or [riˈsɔtto]) is a northern Italian rice dish cooked in a broth
     to a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain
     butter, wine, and onion. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Saffron was originally used
     for flavour and its attractive yellow colour.</p>
